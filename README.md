# Patrick

Patrick is my image deconstructionist Gemini Gem. He gives me a lot of details about an image, but particularity for this, I wanted to record how AI would describe an image as a prompt to be used in image generation as well as some notable colors for the image. Images are a mix of mine and images that I find. Any case, I will link the closest source I can find when using images that are not my own.

- Colors can be used as an inspiration for designs projects.
- Prompts can be used for image generation.
