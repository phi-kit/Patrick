Description: A cute anime girl with long, wavy, split-dye hair that is half pastel pink and half slate gray. She has blue eyes and is wearing a white T-shirt with a large red sequin pixel heart, a black pleated skirt, and a choker inside a clothing store.

Core Concept: A sweet, modern anime girl with a trendy split-dye hairstyle and a cute, gamer-inspired fashion sense, posing in a retail store.

Anatomy & Form: Standard anime proportions with a slender frame. Her pose is gentle and slightly demure, with one hand delicately touching her hair. She has a soft, friendly facial expression.

Artistic Style: High-quality digital anime illustration. It employs clean line art, soft cel-shading, and a strong depth-of-field effect (bokeh) to separate the character from the photorealistic background.

Primary Prompt: masterpiece, best quality, ultra-detailed, 1girl, solo, beautiful anime girl with long wavy split-dye hair (half pastel lavender-pink, half slate gray), beautiful detailed blue eyes, soft smile, looking at viewer, wearing a white t-shirt with a large red sequin pixel heart graphic, black pleated mini-skirt, sheer black tights, and a black o-ring choker, standing in a clothing store, photorealistic blurred background, soft lighting, bokeh.

### Hair & Makeup

Resemblance: While an original design, the distinct half-and-half hair color is a popular trope seen in characters like Shoto Todoroki from My Hero Academia or various V-Tubers, though the colors and style are unique.

Makeup: Appears very light and natural. There is subtle definition around the eyes and a natural pink tint to the lips, enhancing a youthful and sweet appearance.

Hair: Long, thick, and wavy, flowing down past her shoulders. The hair is parted neatly in the middle to showcase the two distinct colors.

Hair color: A "split-dye" or "half-and-half" style. The right side of her hair is a soft, pastel lavender-pink, while the left side is a muted, slate gray-blue.

### Fashion

Attachments & Gear: A thin black choker featuring a small, silver-colored O-ring at the center. She also wears a simple, plain black wristband on her right wrist.

Top: A classic white, short-sleeved crewneck t-shirt. The design is dominated by a large, 8-bit style pixel heart graphic, which is rendered with a texture suggesting it is made of shiny red sequins.

Bottom: A short, black pleated mini-skirt. It is worn over a pair of semi-sheer black tights.
