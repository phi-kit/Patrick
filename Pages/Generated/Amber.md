Description: A digital illustration of a beautiful anime girl with long, magenta and blue hair, wearing a white t-shirt with a colorful hummingbird graphic, and ripped jeans, posing confidently in a brightly lit shopping mall.

Core Concept: A confident and fashionable young woman embodying a modern, vibrant anime aesthetic, captured in a candid pose within a shopping mall.

Anatomy & Form: A stylized female figure with proportions typical of modern anime and manga art: a slender torso and waist, long limbs (implied), and a small face dominated by large, expressive eyes. She is shown from the upper thighs up in a dynamic, confident pose.

Artistic Style: High-detail, contemporary anime digital illustration. The style is characterized by clean line art, vibrant colors with soft gradient shading, and a photorealistic, depth-of-field-blurred background that contrasts with the stylized character.

Ethnicity: Asian, as depicted through the common visual conventions and art style of Japanese anime.

Primary Prompt: A high-resolution anime art masterpiece of a beautiful girl posing in a shopping mall. She has long, vibrant hair that is magenta on top and fades to cyan blue at the tips. She is wearing a knotted white crop top with a colorful watercolor hummingbird graphic, ripped denim jeans with a studded black belt, and a denim jacket tied around her waist. Bright, cheerful lighting, shallow depth of field with a blurred mall background, modern anime style.

### Hair & Makeup

Resemblance: The character is an archetype of a trendy, attractive young woman in anime, not based on a specific person.

Makeup: The makeup is stylized to emphasize her features in an anime fashion. Her large blue eyes are defined by sharp black eyeliner and long lashes. She has a touch of pink blush on her cheeks and a glossy, light pink lip color.

Hair: The hair is very long, thick, and straight with some gentle waves and layers for volume.

Hair color: A striking gradient or ombr√© hair color. The roots and upper portion are a vibrant magenta/fuchsia, which smoothly transitions into a bright cyan/turquoise blue at the lower ends and tips.

### Fashion

Attachments & Gear:

A thick, black leather belt with two rows of square, silver-colored pyramid studs and a large rectangular buckle. A small, jeweled quatrefoil charm dangles from a belt loop.

A silver-colored chain bracelet on her left wrist and a beaded or solid bangle on her right.

Dangling earrings with a slim, star-like design.

Top: A classic white crew-neck t-shirt, which has been tied into a knot at the front to create a cropped, midriff-baring style. It features a large, vibrant graphic of a hummingbird rendered in a colorful, watercolor splatter style.

Bottom: Light-wash, ripped denim jeans. A matching denim jacket is tied around her waist, with the sleeves hanging down her sides.
