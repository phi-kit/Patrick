Description: A beautiful, artistic close-up portrait of an elegant woman with long, wavy, silver-blue hair. She is in profile, wearing glasses with a gold chain, a black lace top, and elaborate gold and sapphire jewelry.

Core Concept: An intimate and melancholic portrait of a beautiful fantasy noblewoman, adorned with striking silver-blue hair and rich sapphire jewelry.

Anatomy & Form: A close-up portrait focusing on the head and shoulders of a young woman in profile. She possesses idealized features: a straight nose, full lips, defined cheekbones, and a delicate jawline.

Artistic Style: Hyper-detailed digital illustration. The artwork is characterized by a soft, airbrushed rendering style combined with sharp, intricate details, particularly in the hair, jewelry, and eyelashes, fitting a modern fantasy or "manhwa" aesthetic.

Ethnicity: Caucasian, with highly stylized, idealized features common to fantasy art.

History: Chained eyewear, known as lorgnettes or featuring pince-nez chains, was a fashionable accessory in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This artwork reimagines this historical element within a modern fantasy context, blending classic elegance with magical aesthetics.

Primary Prompt: A hyper-detailed digital masterpiece portrait of a beautiful, elegant woman in profile with long, flowing, dusty silver-blue hair. She wears thin-framed glasses with a delicate gold chain, a black lace top, and elaborate gold and sapphire jewelry. Dramatic studio lighting with a strong rim light making her hair glow. Her makeup is a vibrant purple eyeshadow. Introspective, melancholic mood, fantasy art style.

### Hair & Markup

Resemblance: The character is an original creation in a popular online art style and does not represent a specific person. The aesthetic is similar to artists known for romantic fantasy portraits, such as WLOP or Sakimichan.

Makeup: The makeup is bold and precise. It features a dramatic, blended cut-crease eyeshadow in shades of vibrant purple and violet, accentuated by sharp, black winged eyeliner and long, thick eyelashes. Her lips are painted in a saturated rose-pink with a soft, matte finish.

Hair: Long, thick, and voluminous, styled in gentle, flowing waves.

Hair color: A multi-tonal, dusty silver-blue. The color shifts between shades of periwinkle, lavender-gray, and bright silver, giving it immense depth and a magical quality

### Fashion

Attachments & Gear:

- A large, ornate pendant featuring a central oval sapphire set in a detailed gold filigree mount, hanging from a gold chain.
- Matching gold drop earrings with faceted blue sapphires.
- Round, thin-framed wire glasses. A decorative, double-stranded gold chain is attached to the temple of the glasses, draping elegantly behind her ear.

Top: A high-collared black garment. The collar is a solid, smooth band, while the shoulders and chest are made of a transparent, intricate floral lace.
