High-resolution photograph of a modern, sculptural piece of playground equipment designed like a stylized red dragonfly. A central gray metal pole supports the large, red metal insect form, whose perforated wings suspend two black pendulum platforms for standing on. The unique structure is situated in a park on a bed of wood chip mulch, with a dense forest of tall green trees in the background under a bright, overcast sky. Centered composition, eye-level shot.
