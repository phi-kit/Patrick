### Prompt

A high-resolution, high-angle photograph of a dense, overgrown field of dried Common Teasel. The entire frame is filled with the brittle, tan-colored stalks and prickly, ovoid seed heads. The lighting is soft and diffused from an overcast sky. In the background, the top of a wooden fence is visible. The image is a study of natural texture and pattern.
