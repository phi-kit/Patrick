Core Concept: A single, fresh green maple seed, a natural aerodynamic marvel, captured at rest on a man-made concrete surface.

Description: A detailed close-up photo of a single green maple seed, known as a samara or helicopter seed, lying on the rough gray texture of a concrete sidewalk.

History: The samara's winged shape is an evolutionary adaptation for wind dispersal. As it falls, its weight and aerodynamic properties cause it to autorotate, creating lift and slowing its descent. This allows the wind to carry it a greater distance from the parent tree, reducing competition and increasing the chance of successful germination.

Primary Prompt: A high-detail macro photograph of a single, fresh green maple seed samara resting on a rough, textured gray concrete surface. The papery wing shows intricate venation. Diffuse, even lighting with no harsh shadows, photorealistic, sharp focus.
