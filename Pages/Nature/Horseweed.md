A high-resolution, top-down close-up photograph of a bushy Horseweed (Erigeron canadensis) plant in a dry lawn. The delicate green stems are covered in hundreds of tiny, bead-like white flower buds. The lighting is soft and even from an overcast day. The background is a mix of dry grass and soil. Ultra-realistic, botanical detail.
