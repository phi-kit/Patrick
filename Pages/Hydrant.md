* **Prompt:** A high-angle, highly detailed, realistic photograph of a weathered yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant is made of rough cast iron with chipped paint and visible grime on its bolts and seams. It stands in a patch of dry, sparse brown grass and dirt. The lighting is diffuse and overcast, creating soft, subtle shadows.
