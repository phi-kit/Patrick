### Prompt

Extreme close-up, top-down photograph of a dense bed of smooth, dry, water-worn river stones. The frame is completely filled with a variety of rounded, ovoid pebbles in shades of gray, blue-gray, and tan. The lighting is perfectly soft and diffuse from an overcast sky, eliminating all shadows and highlighting the subtle, granular texture on each matte stone. High-resolution texture study, abstract realism.
