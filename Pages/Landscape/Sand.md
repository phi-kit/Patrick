Mesmerizing abstract photograph of shallow, clear water flowing over a sandy beach. The receding tide creates intricate, marbled, tree-like patterns as it sorts the dark mineral sand from the lighter tan sand. The surface is glossy and reflective with subtle ripples. High-angle close-up, high-detail texture study, capturing fluid motion. Lit by soft, diffuse daylight.

### Prompt

Minimalist abstract photograph from a top-down perspective, capturing the texture of smooth, wet beach sand. The frame is filled with the fine, granular surface in neutral gray and brown tones. The top edge is a glossy, mirror-like reflection of a bright overcast sky. The main surface has subtle, soft, cloud-like patterns of lighter sand. Serene, calm mood, high-resolution texture study.
