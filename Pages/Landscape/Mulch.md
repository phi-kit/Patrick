### Prompt

Extreme close-up, top-down photograph of a textured bed of dry, weathered wood chip mulch. The frame is completely filled with a chaotic layer of splintery, non-uniform wood fragments in shades of tan, brown, and gray. Low-angle afternoon sunlight rakes across the surface, creating sharp, dramatic shadows that emphasize the rough, three-dimensional texture. High-resolution texture study.
